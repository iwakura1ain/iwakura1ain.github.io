Hello stranger, welcome to my tiny little corner on the wired. 
</p>

## Who am I?
Im a CS student currently living in Korea. I like to code, draw, cook, and generally have fun. I love meeting new people online and offline, so feel free to contact me at [ ].

## Where am I? 
Some of the posts that I might make fall into a few categories such as...  

* Documentation on what I've learned while wrestling a computer
* Information on places I've been to and how I enjoyed them 
* Reviews about books, movies, and other types of media 
* Drunk ramblings 

<!-- Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/poole/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mdo). -->
