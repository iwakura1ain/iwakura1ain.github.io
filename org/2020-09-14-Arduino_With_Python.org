                * Arduino with python
https://realpython.com/arduino-python/#hello-world-with-arduino-and-python
Before you write your Python program to drive Arduino, you have to upload the Firmata sketch so that you can use that protocol to control the board. The sketch is available in the Arduino IDE’s built-in examples.
To open it, access the File menu, then Examples, followed by Firmata, and finally StandardFirmata:

The sketch will be loaded into a new IDE window. To upload it to the Arduino, you can follow the same steps you did before:

Plug the USB cable into the PC.
Select the appropriate board and port on the IDE.
Press Upload.
After the upload is finished, you won’t notice any activity on the Arduino. To control it, you still need a program that can communicate with the board through the serial connection. To work with the Firmata protocol in Python, you’ll need the pyFirmata package, which you can install with pip:

#+begin_src bash
  pip install pyfirmata  
#+end_src

After the installation finishes, you can run an equivalent Blink application using Python and Firmata:

#+begin_src python
import pyfirmata
import time

board = pyfirmata.Arduino('/dev/ttyACM0')

while True:
    board.digital[13].write(1)
    time.sleep(1)
    board.digital[13].write(0)
    time.sleep(1)
  
#+end_src
