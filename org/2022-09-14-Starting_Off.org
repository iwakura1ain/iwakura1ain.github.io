* About this Blog
This blog is primarily running *Jekyll* integrated with *Emacs* and *org-mode*.
I've also added some helper functions that lets me publish org files into markdown, which is then processed by jekyll.

- Define exporter function /org-md-publish-to-md/
  : export org -> markdown
#+begin_src lisp
;; https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2013-10/msg00543.html
(defun org-md-publish-to-md (plist filename org-export-publishing-directory)
  "Publish an org file to Markdown.

FILENAME is the filename of the Org file to be published.  PLIST
is the property list for the given project.  PUB-DIR is the
publishing directory.

Return output file name."
  (org-publish-org-to 'md filename ".markdown" plist org-export-publishing-directory))
